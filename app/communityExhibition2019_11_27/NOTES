A flurry of circles drifting across the viewport

Circles are of variable size. Mostly tiny. some middling. Occasionally huge.

Circles are created offscreen, drift across the viewport, and are discarded.

We try to keep some minimum number of circles in-view.

We shoot for visual interest.

We have wind. The drift vector of a circle is its personal vector + wind. 

Wind shifts direction and strength randomly, shifting and rotating

Circles are sometimes generated in clumps. A spatter of tiny circles.

Circles are rendered to a field of cells.

A cell's color depends on the number and proximity of local circles. Circles have radiance. Closer higher, further lower, until zero.

We will render all this audially too.

Gravity?
