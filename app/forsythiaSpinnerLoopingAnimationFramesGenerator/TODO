clean code


make ui nicer. 
  format view. add label with frameindex, eta, etc.

use integers (instead of doubles) for all stripe length calculations.
we are getting a little skip at the end of long (54000 frame) loops and I think it's because of rounding error.

increase root noise in composer. Needs more root random. Too much symmetry presently
We might even have a special set of first-jigs for the root rectangles. That's a little involved tho.

the pink in the modified toystory palette should be a little redder
