Try some new color selection algs
vary selection over 
  distance from center
    change palette
    change entropy
  X or Y axis
    palette
    entropy
    
Get some contrast. Less field of noise.

Instead of constantly switching around the params on our main class, 
  create a few composition-genre-specific classes. Run THIS to get THESE.
  or param-sets
  or packages
  or something
  
Do a better stroked renderer
  Instead of stroking each leaf polygon, thus stroking many segs multiple times, thus getting some rather thickened strokes
  gather all segs into a set, cull coincident segs,  and draw each one only once
  thus we get more uniform drawing.

A front end

Provides UI and whatever for a single compositon generator

---

We will have a number of composition generators
each composition generator gets its own package
in package
  the CompositionGenerator instance, probably a subclass of CompositionGenerator_Basic
  a PNG image, the sample image
  all relevant classes. 
    composer, renderer, etc
    maybe subclasses that share stuff, maybe just local classes for max stability yet tweakability
    maybe we just have a bunch of interfaces in the root package and all concrete 
      instances in these composition generator packages  

1 or more front ends
