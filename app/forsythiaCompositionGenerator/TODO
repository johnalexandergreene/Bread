Try some new color selection algs
vary selection over 
  distance from center
    change palette
    change entropy
  X or Y axis
    palette
    entropy
    
Get some contrast. Less field of noise.

Instead of constantly switching around the params on our main class, 
  create a few composition-genre-specific classes. Run THIS to get THESE.
  or param-sets
  or packages
  or something
  
Do a better stroked renderer
  Instead of stroking each leaf polygon, thus stroking many segs multiple times, thus getting some rather thickened strokes
  gather all segs into a set, cull coincident segs,  and draw each one only once
  thus we get more uniform drawing.

AN ENTROPY CONTROL STRATEGY
################################

L0 : maybe entropize 100%, maybe 50, maybe 0

L1 : entropize 100%

L2 : Entropize proportionally by distance from y-center-axis and/or center

â€”-also

Keep scale slightly coarse

Maybe paste a bitmap or 3. Flies, skulls, etc

NEW ORGANIZATION

interface CompositionGenerator

  generateComposition
  
  getImage(w,h,border,backgroundcolor,bordercolor)
  
  setComposer

  setColorMapper 
  
  getSample

abstract CompositionGenerator_Basic 
  concrete instances of interface methods
  import grammar 
  export image
  export whatever. Shapetree? 

A front end

Provides UI and whatever for a single compositon generator

---

We will have a number of composition generators
each composition generator gets its own package
in package
  the CompositionGenerator instance, probably a subclass of CompositionGenerator_Basic
  a PNG image, the sample image
  all relevant classes. 
    composer, renderer, etc
    maybe subclasses that share stuff, maybe just local classes for max stability yet tweakability
    maybe we just have a bunch of interfaces in the root package and all concrete 
      instances in these composition generator packages  

1 or more front ends

FC = forsythia composition

0012 is index within series

do big areas. ie, cap polygons at some level, just short of the leaf
OR, delete some polygons post-build
