Transform from one Forsythia Composition (FC) to another.
Get a bunch of incremental compositions. Thus create frames.

Given FC0 and FC1

For each polygon in FC0 get corresponding polygon in FC1

Corresponding means
  centroids are close
  levels are close
  maybe relationships with other polygons are similar
  
If there are leftover polygons then use a parent polygon instead and, I dunno, crossfade the lines

from map of corresponding polygons get map of corresponding segs and points

for each corresponding point-pair get incremental points along joining line

That should do it.
