Moving blobs, possibly rendered in fields of CA rules.
  CA rules like Conway's life and thereabouts
  so the rendering will be coarse. 
Or we could just render them as color gradients. Moving, whelmeresque possibly. 

blob could be metablobs, metaballs, verlet geometry, bouncing balls, hotdogs or whatever
blobs can be inside blobs, wiggling and bouncing around in there.

IDEA000 : Inflation, deflation of blobs
Blobs sould grow... inflate. And shrink, shrivel.
Merge? Split? Spawn? Perambulate?

IDEA001 : blobs could be placed in a pattern. placed at the intersection-points in a forsythia composition, for example. 
Then they could be inflated until they collide and press, thus differentiating the space pleasantly. Like the innards of an orange maybe. 

IDEA002 : Rendering as cell-rule fields in a cell system. Do it coarsely. It could be intense.
