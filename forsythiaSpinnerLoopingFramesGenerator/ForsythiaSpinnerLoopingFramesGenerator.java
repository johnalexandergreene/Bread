 * Given
 *   a viewport definition (height and width) 
 *   a flow direction (NESW)
 *   a grammar that contains a number of retangular metagons
 *   the path to an export dir for the frames
 *   
 * gather the rectangular metagons
 * 
 * create a strip of rectangles to cover the viewport.
 * This is the startend.
 * 
 * cultivate the rectangles. Render to viewport (and to a frame, and export that frame)
 * move the viewport across the startend, 1 pixel row at a time
 * when we hit the edge create a new adjoining rectangle
 * keep moving.
 * when the viewport leaves a rectangle, discard the rectangle.
 * (but don't discard the startend)
 * keep adding rectangles and reaversing them until the sum of the rectangles (including the startend) meets our desired loop length.
 * After that we move back to the startend
 * keep moving until we arrive back at out start position.
 * then we're done.
